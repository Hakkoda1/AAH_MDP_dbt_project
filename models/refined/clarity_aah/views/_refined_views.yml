A prescription can have multiple fills.  This item indicates if the fill is a partial one. If the patient can only pay for a smaller supply or the pharmacy may only have a small amount of the medication left to dispense, then the actual amount dispensed will be different from the intended amount, which is what the prescriber intended the patient to receive. For example, if the patient has a fill of 30 tabs for a Daily medication for 30 days of supply, a partial fill of 15 tabs will cover 15 days of supply; and the patient can receive the rest of the fill later when the patient can pay or the pharmacy has more to dispense. This flag is also used in adjudication to let the insurer know that a fill is a partial one and the insurance company will adjust the payment amount accordingly."
